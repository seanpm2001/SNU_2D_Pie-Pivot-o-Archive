# About

See above

Also:

YouTube was a major factor in the suicide of Adam (Pie Pivot-o) due to geoblocking and false age restrictions, it built up to Adams funeral.

At the time I made this, I felt like I was wasting my time. I now realize I wasn't. Most archives contain just the videos, but I also have the thumbnails, descriptions, and other data.

I can't upload the videos here due to copyright and size issues, but here are some sources:

[Archive.org - Pie Pivot-o Archive](https://archive.org/details/PiePivotO)

[Original channel link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUsll_G21euzazrRMuO6M7Q/)

[Funeral Gofundme (expired)](https://www.gofundme.com/adam-suonborais-funeral)

R.I.P

Adam (Pie Pivot-o)

2003-2019 (aged 15)
