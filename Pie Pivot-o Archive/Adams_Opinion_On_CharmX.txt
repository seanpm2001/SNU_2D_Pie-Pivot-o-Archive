What Are My Thoughts On Charmx? Well, he's a good reaction channel. Charmx, unlike other reaction channels, gives out his thoughts and discusses the topic he's reacting to. He's made the YTP genre more popular and even made small youtube poop channels popular like myself, so big ups on him. But is he a good youtube channel? Well, despite giving his thoughts, it's sometimes repetitive like "this is very chaotic," he's still giving thots but I think someone like him can expand than just that. Also sometimes his camera defocuses, which can make his videos annoying to look at. And the fact that he pronounced my name wrong almost made me report his channel, but I'm not a bias brony who rants on cartoons not following logic despite that it's a cartoon, and because of him, I've boomed in popularity, so thank you Charmx. But there's one thing I hate about him. He gets more views leeching off other peoples videos while the original content creators who put in more effort gets the lower hand. I'm giving him a bonafide D+ï»¿
